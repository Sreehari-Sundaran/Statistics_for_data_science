# Statistics for Data Science

Basics(Introduction to Advanced Mathematics)

* **Statistics**\-Analyzing data Obtained from a Sample  
* **Sample**\-Part of Whole Population  
* **M**\=Successes in Population  
* **N**\=Total Population  
* **x**\=Successes in Sample  
* **n**\=Total Sample from Population  
* **Mean(Measure of Central Tendency)**  
  * Average of components  
  * Value of components/No of components  
  *  Μ symbol (pronounced "mew")=Mean of Population  
  * x bar (x̄) symbol=Mean of Sample  
  * Outliers Effect Result  
    * Eg : 1,2,3,**100,150**,4,5  
    * The highlighted terms are outliers which will effect the result of mean,So we have median and mode  
* **Median**  
  * Number present at the centre of data set  
  * If there are Odd number of terms-Simply take the middle term  
    * Eg. 1,2,**3**,4,5  
  * If there are even number of terms,simply add the even number of terms and divide it by 2  
    * Eg 1,2,**3,4**,5,6  
    * Median \=(4+3)/2=3.5  
* **Mode**  
  * The number that occurs most often  
    * Eg: 3,3,3,3,6,9  
      * Here the Mode is 3  
    * Eg:3,3,6,6,9  
      * Here the mode is 3 and 6  
  * If all Values are equal,then mode will be zero
